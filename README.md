# Scripts

A collection of scripts I use, most of them [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and intended to be run with [Babashka](https://babashka.org/).
Namespaces not built into Babashka or loaded explicitly by `babashka.deps/add-deps` or `babashka.pods/load-pod` can be found [here](https://github.com/exupero/bblib).
